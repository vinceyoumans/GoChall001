# Problem 10 — Summation of primes
“The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.”

For this one, we will need to re-use our isPrime() function. Basically, we need to go from 2 to the 2000000 and check every number. If it is prime, then add it up to a variable.
